# MD-coronavirus
Data about Coronavirus in Maryland, US (2020), from https://coronavirus.maryland.gov/

Please note that the data is provided as is. There is a lot to transcribe and it's still a manual operation (MDH doesn't provide a way to download the data and it's difficult to automate the data collection). So they may be typo. Please consult the official MDH website for official data.

I'm learning GitHub and copying content from the far more knowledgable J-E Poirrier here: https://github.com/jepoirrier/MD-coronavirus
