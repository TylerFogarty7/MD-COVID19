# MD-coronavirus
Data about Coronavirus in Maryland, US (2020), from https://coronavirus.maryland.gov/

I copy the figures from the site daily and the charts are provided on an as-is basis. Please consult the official MDH website for official data. I also recommend https://covidtracking.com/data and https://github.com/jepoirrier/MD-coronavirus for historical data. 

For R code and graphs, please see jepoirrier's repo here: https://github.com/jepoirrier/MD-coronavirus
